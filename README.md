# Senquential-Convex-Programming-for-Trajectory-Planning

Use sequential convex programming (SCP) to address the collaboration of multiple connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in different scenarios. 
- A quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem is formulated. 
- Then with the SCP, the nonconvex QCQP problem is reduced to a quadratic programming (QP) problem. 
Therefore, the computational efficiency is improved, whereby the implementation in different scenarios of autonomous driving is realized in real time.
